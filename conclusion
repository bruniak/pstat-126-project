Throughout the modeling process, we found that:

carat was by far the strongest predictor. Variables like table and x had little to no significant impact. Log-
transformation greatly improved model fit and interpretation. Quality-related factors like color and clarity

refined the modelâ€™s accuracy.
This analysis confirms that while carat is the primary driver of diamond price, incorporating other physical
and qualitative attributes leads to a more accurate and interpretable predictive model.
